NFL AI Coach
This repository contains an AI-powered NFL coaching assistant that uses OpenAI's language models and LangChain to help make informed play-calling decisions based on a knowledge base of football-related documents. It also answers general queries about football strategy, rules, and analytics.

Features
Knowledge Base Creation: The AI loads various football documents (e.g., NFL rulebooks, football analytics articles) and creates a searchable knowledge base using embeddings and FAISS vector storage.
AI-powered Question Answering: Leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 model to answer football-related questions using the knowledge base.
Play-Calling Recommendations: Analyzes game situations, player stats, opponent data, and win probabilities to recommend optimal plays.
Customizable: Supports integration of additional football resources (PDFs, articles, books) into the knowledge base for broader insights.
How it Works
1. Knowledge Base Setup
The AI coach loads documents, such as NFL rulebooks and football analytics reports, and creates embeddings using OpenAI's language models. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector store to enable efficient document retrieval.

2. QA Chain Setup
Once the knowledge base is ready, the AI coach sets up a retrieval-based Question-Answering (QA) system using the vector store and OpenAI's GPT-3 API. You can interact with the AI by asking football-related questions.

3. Play-Calling Algorithm
The AI coach can suggest optimal plays by analyzing:

Game Situation: Current down, yardage, field position, and other situational factors.
Opponent Data: Tendencies or weaknesses based on historical data.
Player Data: Player performance metrics like recent form and effectiveness in specific scenarios.
Win Probabilities: Estimated chances of winning based on various factors.
The AI retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base to suggest plays that increase your chances of winning.

4. User Interaction
The AI operates through an interactive loop, where users can either query general football-related questions or ask the AI to recommend a play based on the current game situation.

Setup
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
OpenAI API Key (for GPT-based responses)
Football-related documents (PDFs, text files, etc.)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nfl-ai-coach.git
cd nfl-ai-coach
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your environment variables by creating a .env file and adding your OpenAI API key:

makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Document Preparation
To create a rich knowledge base, you'll need to provide the AI with football-related documents such as:

NFL Rulebook PDFs
Football analytics articles
Football playbooks or strategy guides
Place these documents in the appropriate paths as configured in the script (e.g., path/to/nfl_rulebook.pdf).

Running the AI Coach
Once the setup is complete, you can run the main interaction loop:

bash
Copy code
python ai_author_bot.py
You will enter an interactive session where you can:

Ask general football-related questions.
Request the AI to suggest a play based on a specific game situation.
Example Interaction
vbnet
Copy code
Welcome to the NFL AI Coach! Type 'exit' to quit.

Enter your query or game situation: call play for 3rd and 5
AI Response: Based on the current situation, the best play would be a short pass to the RB, as the defense has struggled with screen passes, and the RB has shown great efficiency in short-yardage situations.
Customization
Add More Documents: You can easily extend the knowledge base by adding more football documents in PDF or text format. Update the document paths in the setup_knowledge_base() function.
Control Model Creativity: You can adjust the temperature parameter in the setup_qa_chain() function to control how creative or conservative the AIâ€™s responses are.
Future Enhancements
Add support for real-time NFL data feeds (e.g., player performance, opponent stats) for more dynamic play-calling recommendations.
Extend the knowledge base with machine learning-based football analytics models for deeper insights.
Integrate a front-end interface for easier interaction.
